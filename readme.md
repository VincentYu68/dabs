TODO
---------------
- Add examples where needed (probably concerning indirect code)
- Make zero_torques read and restore torques
- Make some explicit ATTR tuples instead of forcing users to construct themselves
- Lessen code duplication among readers/writers with object orientation
- Unify error handling across the gajillion places in the code
- Split all this into seperate files appropriately
